# Instructions:

  ## Clone the repository to your local PC:
  - git clone https://github.com/Tapas-Services/hiring_test_assessment.git
  - cd ./hiring_test_assessment

  ## Add your credentials:

  - git config user.name "Your_Github_Username"
  - git config user.email "Your_Github_Email"

  ## Create a branch:

  - git checkout -b "FirstName_LastName_RollNo"

  ## After you make changes in the `Questionnaire` directory:

  - git add .
  - git commit -m "Commit_Message"
  - git push

  - Note: You can make as many commits as needed. Your last commit will be considered final.

# The Test:

  ## Structure:
  - There are 3 programming questions in a pdf file in the `Questionnaire` directory.
  - You can use any programming language that you like.
  - You need to make sure that the program runs properly and gives correct output (No syntax, compiling, run-time, semantics error)
  - For `Q1` the code should print all the output on terminal.
  - For `Q2` take input (arr_size, arr_elements) from the user and it should print the missing element.
  - For `Q3` code should print the number of solutions for 11 -> 0, 13 -> 1, 42 -> 3, 255 -> ?

  ## Timing:
  - You will have 80 mins to solve them.
  - After 80 mins the repository will be made private, which means you will not be able to add more commits and your last commit will be considered final.
  - Keep updating your git branch regulary to ensure you don't miss the timeout.
